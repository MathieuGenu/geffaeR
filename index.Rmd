## Introduction

When a lot of distance sampling campaign are made, analysis have to be done to estimate abundance with tools such as distance, dsm, kriging. But from a campaign to another, the objectives are not always the same, while the method remains the same.

Ex : For a particular campaign, we want a cds analysis for all the campaign but for species a and b. For the other campaign we want a cds analysis for each session of the campaign for species b and c. So there are specificities that will be managed by the user but the method can be set to be generic and put in a package, so we don't have to modify the method for every campaign (illustrated fig1).

```{r, fig.cap = "fig1 : Analysis of observation campaign before and after the creation of geffaeR", echo = F, fig.retina = 3, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("doc/assets/index/before_after_EN_total.png")
```


This package proposes functions to manipulate observation campaign for the estimation of abondance indexes by using several tools for different type of analysis, such as :

* CDS analysis (Coventional Distance Sampling) using Distance package ([Distance](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Distance))
* Kriging
* CDS analysis using Stan ([rstan](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rstan))
* DSM (Density Surface Modelling) using dsm package ([dsm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dsm))
